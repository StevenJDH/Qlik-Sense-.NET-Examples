# Qlik Sense .NET Examples

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/StevenJDH/Qlik-Sense-.NET-Examples)

A growing collection of .NET-based examples that show how to perform various actions in Qlik Sense programmatically. I decided to create these to help people along with their custom solutions for common reoccurring tasks. However, software architectural concepts and SOLID principles have been mostly ignored to keep things simple. I will provide more examples as my time permits and prioritize those that are specifically requested.

## Available examples
* _QS Data Load Script Dumper_ - A demo for how one could dump all the data load scripts for use in version control software like git to track changes.

## Compatibility
* .NET Framework 4.7.2
